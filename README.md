## Description:
`true_false.py` is a simple Python script that runs a quiz game where the user answers True or False questions. The script prompts the user with a series of questions, evaluates the responses, and calculates the total score at the end. The questions and answers are pre-defined in the script.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Day-2-True-False-Quiz-Game.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Day-2-True-False-Quiz-Game
```
Run the script:

```bash
python true_false.py
```
The script will prompt you with each question and ask you to input your answer as either "True" or "False." Based on your responses, it will calculate your score and display it at the end of the game.

Example Output:
```bash
Q.1: The Great Wall of China is visible from space. (True/False): False
Your current score is 1/1

Q.2: Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. (True/False): True
Your current score is 2/2

Final Score: 5/5
```
How it works:
1. The script imports the necessary classes and data.
2. The questions and answers are stored as dictionaries in the data variable.
3. The user is prompted with each question, and the response is evaluated.
4. After all the questions are answered, the script displays the user's total score.
